## Getting Started

This monorepo is powered by [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) you can get all the apps and packages running with one simple command

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

With all the above installed, you're two steps away from having everything up and running

1. run `yarn` to install top-level dependencies
2. run `yarn dev` to bootstrap all the applications and packages

The documentation site will be available at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)

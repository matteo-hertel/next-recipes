# Next Recipes

Production-ready example for NextJs

## Motivations

NextJs has an incredible collection of [examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) that helps developers set up Next with whatever piece of technology they are trying to use or showcase best practices for Next development

I've used the NextJs example repository many many times and it's amazing, however, one of the shortcomings is the fact that it doesn't go very deep, explains briefly the problem in the Read me and then there is a basic next app with the example integration of best practice

The motivation for this repository is to get the community to crowdsource examples that are beyond the simple hello world stage and showcase real production-ready solutions for whatever they faced in the past effectively contributing to the wider community using NextJS

## How is this different from the existing examples

I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but in the few years I've been using next so many times I ended up facing a problem that is not covered by the documentation or the Next examples, there are tons of articles out there that can help with problems but centralizing all of that knowledge into one repository will, in my opinion, make the difference for the next (pun not intended) person facing the same problem
